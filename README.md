The project aims to build a machine learning model that can detect tampering on PAN cards by analyzing images for inconsistencies or alterations. By training a model on both authentic and tampered PAN card images, the system will learn to identify signs of forgery. This is useful in verifying the authenticity of documents and preventing identity theft or fraud.
